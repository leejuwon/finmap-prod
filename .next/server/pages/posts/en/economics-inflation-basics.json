Rates</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>Inflation refers to a sustained increase in overall price levels, which reduces the purchasing power of money.<br>A key concept for new investors is <strong>real interest rate = nominal interest rate − inflation rate</strong>.<br>When the real interest rate is negative, savings accounts and cash-based assets lose purchasing power.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"why-inflation-matters\">Why Inflation Matters</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Even with the same amount of money, rising prices mean you can <strong>buy less</strong>.  </li>\n<li>Households face higher living costs, companies face increased production expenses,<br>and central banks respond with <strong>interest rate policies</strong>.  </li>\n<li>Understanding inflation is essential for long-term financial planning.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"cpi-vs-perceived-inflation\">CPI vs. Perceived Inflation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>CPI (Consumer Price Index):</strong><br>The official measure of inflation based on a fixed basket of goods with assigned weights.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Perceived Inflation:</strong><br>The inflation individuals <em>feel</em>, based on their personal spending patterns.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even when official CPI is low, inflation may feel higher if frequently purchased items<br>such as food delivery, housing, or transportation rise significantly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tip-track-your-personal-cost-of-living\">Tip: Track Your Personal Cost of Living</h3>\n<p>You can quantify your perceived inflation by tracking<br><strong>monthly price changes</strong> using card statements, shopping apps, or spreadsheets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-inflation-occurs\">Why Inflation Occurs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Demand-Pull Inflation:</strong><br>Economic expansion, wage growth, increased government spending → demand exceeds supply.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Cost-Push Inflation:</strong><br>Rising commodity/energy prices or a weaker currency → higher production costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Expectational Inflation:</strong><br>When people believe “prices will keep rising,” that expectation itself leads businesses to raise prices.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"inflation-and-interest-rates-real-interest-rate\">Inflation and Interest Rates (Real Interest Rate)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Real Interest Rate = Nominal Interest Rate − Inflation Rate</strong>  </li>\n<li>A <strong>negative</strong> real interest rate means cash and deposits <strong>lose purchasing power</strong> over time.  </li>\n<li>Example: Deposit 3% – Inflation 4% = <strong>Real Interest Rate −1%</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"example-table\">Example

id=\"what-inflation-signals-for-financial-markets\">What Inflation Signals for Financial Markets</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Bonds:</strong><br>Higher interest rates → lower bond prices (due to higher discount rates).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Stocks:</strong><br>Inflation can pressure equities short term,<br>but productivity improvements or strong earnings can offset the impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Real Estate:</strong><br>Rising mortgage rates reduce buying demand,<br>but rental income and supply conditions can create mixed effects.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2

<strong>diversification</strong> to reduce single-asset risk.  </li>\n<li>During rate-hike cycles, maintain <strong>healthy cash flow</strong>, including monthly savings and emergency
