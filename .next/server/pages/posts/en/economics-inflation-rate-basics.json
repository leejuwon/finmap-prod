What Happens When Inflation Rises?</h2>\n<p>Inflation refers to an overall increase in price levels.<br>When inflation rises:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The difference between <strong>CPI (Consumer Price Index)</strong> and personal <strong>perceived inflation</strong> becomes important.  </li>\n<li>Real purchasing power declines when inflation outpaces income growth.  </li>\n<li>The concept of <strong>real interest rate = nominal interest rate − inflation rate</strong> becomes essential.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the real interest rate is <strong>negative</strong>, savings and deposits lose purchasing power over time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-the-role-of-interest-rates\">2. The Role of Interest Rates</h2>\n<p>Interest rates reflect the cost of borrowing and the reward for saving.</p>\n<p>Key components include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Policy Rate (Base Rate):</strong><br>Set by the central bank to manage economic activity, inflation, and liquidity.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Deposit &amp; Lending Rates:</strong><br>Affect household savings, mortgage payments, and consumption patterns.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When inflation is high, central banks often raise interest rates to cool demand and stabilize price levels.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-how-asset-prices-react\">3. How Asset Prices React</h2>\n<p>Different asset classes respond differently to inflation and rate changes:</p>\n<h3 id=\"stocks\"><strong>Stocks</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Higher inflation or rising interest rates can pressure stock valuations.  </li>\n<li>However, companies with strong earnings or productivity growth may offset these effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"bonds\"><strong>Bonds</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Rising interest rates lower bond prices due to higher discount rates.  </li>\n<li>Falling rates usually boost bond valuations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"real-estate\"><strong>Real Estate</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Higher mortgage rates reduce housing demand.  </li>\n<li>Rental income and supply conditions determine resilience during inflation cycles.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong><br>Check economic release calendars regularly.<br>Inflation data, policy rate decisions, and employment figures often move markets significantly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"faq\">FAQ</h2>\n<h3 id=\"q-do-inflation-and-interest-rates-always-move-together\"><strong>Q. Do inflation and interest rates always move together?</strong></h3>\n<p>Not necessarily. Timing, expectations, and economic conditions create lags or divergence between the two.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Bank of Korea: Economic Statistics System  </li>\n<li>Statistics Korea: CPI and inflation releases</li>\n</ul>\n"},"lang":"en","otherLangAvailable":true},"__N_SSG":true}
