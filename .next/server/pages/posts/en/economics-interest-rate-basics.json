What Is an Interest Rate?</h2>\n<p>Interest rates represent the <strong>price of time</strong> in financial markets.<br>They reflect compensation for risk, liquidity, and the time value of money.</p>\n<p>General principles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Higher risk → <strong>higher interest rates</strong>  </li>\n<li>Longer maturity → <strong>term premium</strong> (higher rate compared to short-term)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"2-from-policy-rate-→-market-rates-→-deposit-and-loan-rates\">2. From Policy Rate → Market Rates → Deposit and Loan Rates</h2>\n<p>Interest rates flow through the system in the following sequence:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The central bank sets the <strong>policy rate</strong> (base rate).  </li>\n<li>This influences <strong>short-term market rates</strong>, such as call rates or benchmark reference rates.  </li>\n<li>Changes in bank funding costs lead to adjustments in <strong>deposit and lending rates</strong> for households and businesses.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"text-diagram-structure\">Text Diagram (Structure)</h3>\n<p>Policy Rate<br>  ↓<br>Short-Term Market Rates<br>  ↓<br>Bank Funding Costs<br>  ↓<br>Deposit &amp; Loan Rates<br>  ↓<br>Household / Corporate Decisions</p>\n<p>This chain determines borrowing costs, deposit returns, and investment incentives across the economy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-the-inverse-relationship-between-interest-rates-and-bonds\">3. The Inverse Relationship Between Interest Rates and Bonds</h2>\n<p>Interest rates and bond prices move in opposite directions because of the way discounting works:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>When interest rates rise<br>→ discount rates rise<br>→ <strong>present value of fixed cash flows falls</strong><br>→ bond prices decline  </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>When interest rates fall<br>→ discount rates fall<br>→ bond prices rise</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Existing fixed-rate bonds become less attractive when new bonds offer higher yields.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-how-interest-rates-affect-everyday-life\">4. How Interest Rates Affect Everyday Life</h2>\n<p>Interest rate changes impact:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Mortgage and housing loans:</strong><br>Higher rates increase monthly payments and reduce borrowing capacity.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Deposit and savings products:</strong><br>Higher rates increase interest income for savers.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Corporate investment:</strong><br>Higher borrowing costs reduce capital spending and hiring.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Changes in the interest rate cycle flow through the entire economy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-practical-checkpoints-for-individuals\">5.
