It provides a more accurate long-term performance measure than simple returns, which can be distorted by volatility. Investors use CAGR to compare assets, funds, and investment strategies over different periods.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dwonflmnn/image/upload/v1764429447/blog/personalFinance/what-is-cagr-top.png\" alt=\"CAGR concept overview\" title=\"CAGR concept overview\"></p>\n<hr>\n<!-- 가로 스크롤 이미지 4개 블록 -->\n<!-- Horizontal scroll image block -->\n<div style=\"display: flex; gap: 16px; overflow-x: auto; padding: 10px 0;\">\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dwonflmnn/image/upload/v1764429352/blog/personalFinance/cagr1.jpg\"  style=\"height: 180px; border-radius: 8px;\" />\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dwonflmnn/image/upload/v1764429359/blog/personalFinance/cagr2.png\"  style=\"height: 180px; border-radius: 8px;\" />\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dwonflmnn/image/upload/v1764429360/blog/personalFinance/cagr3.jpg\"  style=\"height: 180px; border-radius: 8px;\" />\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dwonflmnn/image/upload/v1764429362/blog/personalFinance/cagr4.jpg\"  style=\"height: 180px; border-radius: 8px;\" />\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"1-introduction\">1. Introduction</h2>\n<p>Many new investors confuse CAGR with simple returns.<br>Although both show investment performance, CAGR provides a clearer picture of consistent growth over time.</p>\n<p>This article explains what CAGR is, how it differs from simple returns, and why it is important for long-term investing.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"2-what-cagr-means-and-how-it-works\">2. What CAGR Means and How It Works</h2>\n<h3 id=\"2-1-definition\">2-1. Definition</h3>\n<p>CAGR answers the question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>“If my investment grew at a steady rate every year, what would that rate be?”</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It smooths out the ups and downs of actual returns and shows the effective annual growth rate over the whole period.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-2-formula\">2-2. Formula</h3>\n<p>CAGR can be calculated as:</p>\n<p>CAGR =\n<span style=\"display:inline-block; margin:0 4px; text-align:center;\">\n  <span style=\"display:block; border-bottom:1px solid #000;\">Ending Value</span>\n  <span style=\"display:block;\">Starting Value</span>\n</span>\n<sup>1 / Years</sup> − 1</p>\n<p>Example:<br>Investing $800 → $1,280 after 3 years:</p>\n<p>CAGR = (1.6)<sup>1/3</sup> − 1 ≈ 16.99%</p>\n<p>In other words, this result is equivalent to earning about 17% per year, every year, on a compound basis.</p>\n<!-- Horizontal scroll image block -->\n<div style=\"display: flex; gap: 16px; overflow-x: auto; padding: 10px 0;\">\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dwonflmnn/image/upload/v1764429364/blog/personalFinance/cagr5.jpg\"  style=\"height: 180px; border-radius: 8px;\" />\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dwonflmnn/image/upload/v1764429366/blog/personalFinance/cagr6.jpg\"  style=\"height: 180px; border-radius: 8px;\" />\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dwonflmnn/image/upload/v1764429367/blog/personalFinance/cagr7.jpg\"  style=\"height: 180px; border-radius: 8px;\" />\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dwonflmnn/image/upload/v1764429368/blog/personalFinance/cagr8.png\"  style=\"height: 180px; border-radius: 8px;\" />\n</div>\n\n<p>By looking at a loss-and-recovery chart, a yearly return table, and a long-term index graph together,<br>you can clearly see why CAGR is more meaningful than a single-point simple return.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"3-how-cagr-differs-from-simple-returns\">3. How CAGR Differs From Simple Returns</h2>\n<h3 id=\"3-1-simple-return-shows-only-total-gain\">3-1. Simple return shows only total gain</h3>\n<p>The simple return formula is:</p>\n<p>Simple Return =\n<span style=\"display:inline-block; margin:0 4px; text-align:center;\">\n  <span style=\"display:block; border-bottom:1px solid #000;\">Ending − Starting</span>\n  <span style=\"display:block;\">Starting</span>\n</span></p>\n<p>In the example:</p>\n<p>(1280 − 800) / 800 = 60%</p>\n<p>This tells us the total gain, but nothing about how the investment moved year by year.<br>Large drawdowns in the middle are completely hidden from this number.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-2-volatility-lowers-cagr\">3-2. Volatility lowers CAGR</h3>\n<p>Consider two investments with the same final value:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Investment A: grows steadily every year  </li>\n<li>Investment B: +50% in year 1, −20% in year 2, +40% in year 3</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if the final values are identical,<br><strong>Investment A will have a higher CAGR</strong>,<br>while <strong>Investment B will show a lower CAGR because of volatility</strong>.</p>\n<p>Simple return focuses only on the start and end points,<br>whereas CAGR reflects the average pace of growth over the entire journey.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"4-practical-use-cases-for-cagr\">4. Practical Use Cases for CAGR</h2>\n<h3 id=\"4-1-long-term-investment-comparison\">4-1. Long-term investment comparison</h3>\n<p>For 3–10 year performance comparisons, CAGR is the industry standard.<br>Mutual funds, ETFs, and pension products often report their results in CAGR terms.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fund A: total return +80% over 5 years  </li>\n<li>Fund B: total return +60% over 5 years</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At first glance, Fund A seems better.<br>But when you calculate CAGR and account for volatility,<br>Fund B might show more stable and attractive performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-2-volatile-assets-such-as-stocks-and-leveraged-etfs\">4-2. Volatile assets such as stocks and leveraged ETFs</h3>\n<p>High-volatility assets can look impressive based on short-term spikes.<br>However, CAGR reveals whether those spikes actually translated into sustainable long-term growth.</p>\n<p>If CAGR is modest despite eye-catching short-term gains,<br>the investment may be riskier than it initially appears.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-3-fair-comparison-across-different-asset-classes\">4-3. Fair comparison across different asset classes</h3>\n<p>You can compare:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Savings accounts  </li>\n<li>Bonds  </li>\n<li>Stocks  </li>\n<li>ETFs  </li>\n<li>Real estate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>all on the same scale using CAGR.<br>By converting everything to <strong>annual compound growth</strong>, you get a fair, apples-to-apples comparison.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"5-conclusion\">5. Conclusion</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CAGR expresses the true annual compound growth rate of an investment.</strong>  </li>\n<li>It is more informative than simple returns, especially when volatility is high.  </li>\n<li>Investors should use CAGR to judge long-term performance and compare different assets or strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want a realistic view of your wealth-building journey,<br>make it a habit to check <strong>both simple returns and CAGR</strong> rather than relying on a single number.</p>\n<p>Related posts:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Compound Interest: How Compounding Really Grows Your Money</strong>  </li>\n<li><strong>DCA Strategy: Building Wealth Through Regular Investing</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- 가로 스크롤 이미지 4개 블록 -->\n<!-- Horizontal scroll image block -->\n<div style=\"display: flex; gap: 16px; overflow-x: auto; padding: 10px 0;\">\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dwonflmnn/image/upload/v1764429370/blog/personalFinance/cagr9.jpg\"  style=\"height: 180px; border-radius: 8px;\" />\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dwonflmnn/image/upload/v1764429354/blog/personalFinance/cagr10.png\"  style=\"height: 180px; border-radius: 8px;\" />\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dwonflmnn/image/upload/v1764429356/blog/personalFinance/cagr11.jpg\"  style=\"height: 180px; border-radius: 8px;\" />\n  <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dwonflmnn/image/upload/v1764429358/blog/personalFinance/cagr12.jpg\"  style=\"height: 180px; border-radius: 8px;\" />\n</div>\n\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"faq\">FAQ</h2>\n<h3 id=\"q1-is-a-higher-cagr-always-better\">Q1. Is a higher CAGR always better?</h3>\n<p>Not always.<br>A high CAGR may come with extreme volatility or concentrated risk.<br>You should always consider drawdowns, diversification, and your own risk tolerance.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"q2-can-cagr-be-negative\">Q2. Can CAGR be negative?</h3>\n<p>Yes.<br>If the ending value is lower than the starting value,<br>CAGR will be negative and will show the average annual rate of loss.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"q3-does-cagr-apply-to-savings-accounts\">Q3. Does CAGR apply to savings accounts?</h3>\n<p>Yes.<br>For fixed-rate savings or deposits, the quoted annual rate is effectively the CAGR.<br>However, frequent deposits or withdrawals can make the realized CAGR slightly different from the nominal rate.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"json-ld\">JSON-LD</h2>\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"Article\",\n  \"headline\": \"What Is CAGR?
