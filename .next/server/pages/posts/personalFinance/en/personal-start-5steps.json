Introduction</h2>\n<p>Starting your first full-time job often comes with excitement—until you realize how little you know about managing your money.<br>Many young professionals struggle with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Where did my money go?”  </li>\n<li>“Should I start with savings or investing?”  </li>\n<li>“What is the right monthly spending limit?”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This guide breaks salary management into <strong>five simple steps</strong> anyone can follow.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"2-step-1--identify-your-fixed-expenses\">2. Step 1 — Identify Your Fixed Expenses</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/personalFinance/economics-personal-start-5steps-mid1-expenses.png\" alt=\"Fixed expense illustration\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"2-1-why-list-your-expenses-first\">2-1. Why list your expenses first?</h3>\n<p>Salary management begins with knowing <strong>exactly where your money goes</strong>.<br>Without a clear picture of fixed expenses, it’s nearly impossible to budget effectively.</p>\n<p>Typical fixed expenses include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rent / utilities  </li>\n<li>Mobile phone bill  </li>\n<li>Insurance premiums  </li>\n<li>Transportation  </li>\n<li>Subscription services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example:<br>If fixed expenses are <strong>$640/month</strong> and your salary is <strong>$2,000/month</strong>,<br>→ fixed expenses account for <strong>32%</strong> of your income.</p>\n<p>The remaining 68% must cover spending, savings, and investing.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"2-2-review-fixed-expenses-three-times\">2-2. Review fixed expenses three times</h3>\n<p>Fixed expenses are not “set forever.”<br>Reviewing them regularly can save $20–$50 per month,<br>which is $240–$600 per year.</p>\n<p>Three key review questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Is this expense truly necessary?</strong><br>– Cancel unused subscriptions  </li>\n<li><strong>Is there a cheaper alternative?</strong><br>– Phone plans and insurance can often be downsized  </li>\n<li><strong>Is the billing cycle optimal?</strong><br>– Annual plans may be cheaper than monthly ones</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"3-step-2--set-a-monthly-spending-limit\">3. Step 2 — Set a Monthly Spending Limit</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/images/personalFinance/economics-personal-start-5steps-mid2-budget.png\" alt=\"Budget pie chart\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"3-1-the-biggest-mistake-beginners-make\">3-1. The biggest mistake beginners make</h3>\n<p>“Save whatever is left at the end of the month” almost never works.<br>If you can spend, you <em>will</em> spend.</p>\n<p>This is why <strong>save-first, spend-later</strong> is essential.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"3-2-use-the-50-30-20-rule-adjusted-for-young-professionals\">3-2. Use the 50-30-20 Rule (Adjusted for young professionals)</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Category</th>\n<th>%</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Essentials</td>\n<td>50%</td>\n<td>Rent + core living expenses</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Self-Development / Leisure</td>\n<td>20%</td>\n<td>Courses, gym, hobbies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Savings / Investing</td>\n<td>30%</td>\n<td>Emergency fund, savings accounts, investments</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><strong>Example: $2,000 monthly income</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Essentials: <strong>$1,000</strong>  </li>\n<li>Self-development: <strong>$400</strong>  </li>\n<li>Savings &amp; investing: <strong>$600</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Adjust the percentages depending on your situation—<br>the key is <strong>setting a limit in advance</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"4-step-3--build-an-emergency-fund-6-months-of-living-costs\">4.

Why emergency funds come before investing</h3>\n<p>Before investing, build a <strong>financial safety net</strong>.<br>Without an emergency fund, unexpected expenses—car repairs, medical bills, sudden moves—force you to break savings or investments.</p>\n<p><strong>Standard emergency fund target:</strong><br>6 months of essential expenses.</p>\n<p>Example:<br>If living expenses are <strong>$950/month</strong>,<br>Emergency fund target = <strong>$5,700</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"4-2-where-should-you-keep-it\">4-2. Where should you keep it?</h3>\n<p>Safety and accessibility matter more than return.</p>\n<p>Recommended:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CMA accounts  </li>\n<li>High-liquidity savings accounts  </li>\n<li>Standard checking/savings accounts</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"5-step-4--use-savings-accounts-to-build-discipline\">5. Step 4 — Use Savings Accounts to Build Discipline</h2>\n<h3 id=\"5-1-savings-accounts-are-training-tools\">5-1. Savings accounts are “training tools”</h3>\n<p>They don’t offer high returns but are ideal for building the habit of saving.<br>For young professionals, <strong>consistency is the highest priority</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-2-recommended-saving-ratio\">5-2. Recommended saving ratio</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>10%–20% of monthly income  </li>\n<li>Prefer 12–24 month terms  </li>\n<li>Use automatic transfers to stay consistent</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"6-step-5--grow-your-wealth-through-compound-investing\">6. Step 5 — Grow Your Wealth Through Compound Investing</h2>\n<h3 id=\"6-1-compound-interest-is-your-strongest-advantage\">6-1. Compound interest is your strongest advantage</h3>\n<p>After building discipline through saving,<br>transition into <strong>compound-growth assets</strong>.</p>\n<p>Compound interest means <strong>earning interest on interest</strong>.<br>Time dramatically accelerates growth.</p>\n<p>Example:<br>$300/month for 10 years at 5% return:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple interest: approx. <strong>$5,160</strong> earned  </li>\n<li>Compound interest: approx. <strong>$5,940</strong> earned<br>→ Difference: <strong>$780</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This gap grows much larger over 15–20 years.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"6-2-try-your-own-numbers-cta\">6-2.
