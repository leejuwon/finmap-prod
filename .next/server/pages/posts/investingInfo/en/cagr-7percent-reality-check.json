The S&amp;P 500’s historical CAGR ranges from 6% to 12% depending on the time period, and volatility, inflation, and taxes significantly reduce real returns. This article provides a detailed, data-based explanation of how a 7% assumption behaves in real markets and how investors should use compound interest and goal calculators to set realistic expectations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/images/investingInfo/cagr-7percent-reality-check-cover.png\" alt=\"cover\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"1-introduction\">1.
