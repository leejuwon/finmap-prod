To understand your true investing performance, you must evaluate CAGR together with MDD, volatility, and the Sharpe ratio. These metrics show how stable your returns were, how deep your losses got, and whether the risks you took were justified. In this article, we explain each metric in simple terms and compare two sample portfolios to illustrate why a stable CAGR is more valuable than a high but unstable one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/images/investingInfo/diagnose-investing-skill-with-cagr-cover.png.png\" alt=\"cover\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"1-introduction\">1. Introduction</h1>\n<p>When investors talk about their results, they often summarize everything with a single number:</p>\n<p><strong>“My CAGR is 9% over the last five years.”</strong></p>\n<p>But this raises critical questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Was the growth stable or extremely volatile?  </li>\n<li>Did the portfolio experience large losses?  </li>\n<li>Was the return achieved efficiently relative to risk?  </li>\n<li>How difficult would it be for most investors to maintain this strategy?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CAGR provides the final outcome, but it does <strong>not</strong> tell the story behind it.</p>\n<p>To accurately assess investing skill, professionals always evaluate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CAGR (Growth)</li>\n<li>MDD (Drawdown)</li>\n<li>VOL (Volatility)</li>\n<li>Sharpe Ratio (Risk-adjusted efficiency)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This article explains how these four metrics work together and how to use them to diagnose your own investing patterns.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"2-hero-layout--cagr-shows-the-growth-but-not-the-risk-behind-it\">2. Hero Layout — “CAGR shows the growth, but not the risk behind it.”</h1>\n<div class=\"hero-grid\">\n  <div class=\"hero-main\">\n    <p class=\"hero-kicker\">Why CAGR alone is not enough</p>\n    <p class=\"hero-summary\">\n      CAGR accurately shows how much your money grew,  \n      but it tells nothing about the risk taken during the journey.  \n      To evaluate real investing skill, you must combine CAGR with MDD, volatility,  \n      and the Sharpe ratio to understand how stable and efficient your returns were.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"hero-card\">\n    <h3>Key Points</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>CAGR shows growth but ignores risk</li>\n      <li>MDD reveals portfolio stress and loss depth</li>\n      <li>Volatility and Sharpe ratio show efficiency and sustainability</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"3-the-limitation-of-cagr-it-does-not-reflect-volatility\">3. The Limitation of CAGR: It Does Not Reflect Volatility</h1>\n<p>CAGR answers the question:</p>\n<p><strong>“How much did my portfolio grow from start to finish?”</strong></p>\n<p>But two investors with the same CAGR may have had wildly different experiences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Investor A had smooth returns with few declines  </li>\n<li>Investor B survived multiple deep losses and large swings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even with identical CAGR, the emotional difficulty and sustainability differ dramatically.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-tip\">\n  <strong>Core Insight:</strong>  \n  CAGR shows the result, but not the journey.  \n  The journey often determines whether an investor can realistically maintain the strategy.\n</div>\n\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"4-what-is-mdd-maximum-drawdown\">4. What Is MDD (Maximum Drawdown)?</h1>\n<p>MDD answers:</p>\n<p><strong>“What was the deepest drop from peak to bottom?”</strong></p>\n<p>Example:<br>Peak $1,000 → Bottom $700 → <strong>MDD = -30%</strong></p>\n<p>MDD reflects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Psychological pressure  </li>\n<li>Strategy risk level  </li>\n<li>Likelihood of quitting during crashes  </li>\n<li>Portfolio fragility</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most investors underestimate how important MDD is until they experience a deep drawdown themselves.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"5-explaining-the-sharpe-ratio-for-beginners\">5. Explaining the Sharpe Ratio for Beginners</h1>\n<p>The Sharpe ratio measures:</p>\n<p><strong>“How efficiently did you earn returns relative to risk?”</strong></p>\n<p>Formula:\nSharpe Ratio = (Portfolio Return − Risk-free Rate) / Volatility</p>\n<p>Interpretation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>High Sharpe → stable and efficient returns  </li>\n<li>Low Sharpe → returns achieved with roller-coaster volatility  </li>\n<li>Negative Sharpe → risk was not rewarded</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For beginners, simply remember:</p>\n<p><strong>Sharpe tells you whether your returns were worth the risk.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"6-table-1--comparing-cagr-volatility-and-sharpe-ratio\">6.

FAQ</h1>\n<p><strong>Q1. Does a higher CAGR mean better investing skill?</strong><br>A: No. Without considering volatility and MDD, the assessment is incomplete.</p>\n<p><strong>Q2. What is considered a “good” Sharpe ratio?</strong><br>A: Generally 0.5 or higher indicates efficient risk management.</p>\n<p><strong>Q3. What is a reasonable MDD level?</strong><br>A: MDD under -15% is relatively stable, depending on strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>Q4. Are high-volatility strategies bad?</strong><br>A: Not always, but they reduce CAGR and are very hard to maintain emotionally.</p>\n<hr>\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"Article\",\n  \"headline\": \"Diagnosing Your Investing Skill Using CAGR: Understanding MDD, Volatility, and Sharpe Ratio\",\n  \"description\": \"To realistically assess investing skill, CAGR must be combined with MDD, volatility, and the Sharpe ratio.
