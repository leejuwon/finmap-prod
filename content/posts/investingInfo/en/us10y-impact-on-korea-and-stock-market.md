# How the U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield (TNX) Impacts the U.S. Economy, Korea, and Global Stock Markets  
— *A complete FinMap premium macro guide* —

> **Summary (10 sentences)**  
> - The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield (TNX) functions as the global discount rate.  
> - When TNX rises, asset valuations across the world adjust downward.  
> - U.S. stock performance varies across value stocks and growth stocks depending on TNX levels.  
> - Korea’s stock market reacts even more sensitively to TNX changes.  
> - A rising TNX typically leads to KRW depreciation and foreign capital outflows.  
> - Companies face higher borrowing costs and valuation multiples contract.  
> - When TNX declines, liquidity returns and risk assets rebound quickly.  
> - Growth stocks—including tech, semiconductor, and long-duration industries—respond most strongly.  
> - The USDKRW exchange rate and TNX move together, influencing Korea’s market direction.  
> - Tracking TNX is essential for both global and Korean equity investors.

> **One-paragraph summary**  
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield is the anchor of global financial markets. TNX affects liquidity, equity valuations, currencies, corporate financing costs, and foreign investment flows. Because Korea is one of the world’s most open and sensitive markets, TNX changes directly shift the USDKRW exchange rate, foreign investor behavior, and KOSPI direction. Understanding TNX is essential for long-term investment timing and risk management.

# 1. Introduction — Why TNX Drives the Global Market

Every global investor watches TNX every single day.  
There is one key reason:

**TNX = the world’s benchmark cost of capital.**

It influences:

- Global liquidity  
- Risk appetite vs risk aversion  
- Growth stock valuation levels  
- Currency movements  
- Capital flows into emerging markets  

Korea, in particular, reacts faster and more intensely due to its high foreign ownership and currency sensitivity.

# 2. Hero Layout — TNX Is the “Heart Rate” of Global Capital

<div class="hero-grid">

    <p class="hero-kicker">TNX = The global discount rate</p>
    <p class="hero-summary">
      The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield determines how global assets are priced.
      Its movements alter valuations, currency trends, and foreign money flows.
      The reason Korean stocks often fall sharply when TNX rises is because TNX directly influences liquidity,
      discount rates, and risk appetite.

    <h3>Key Points</h3>

# 3. How TNX Affects the Economy

When TNX changes, several macro mechanisms follow immediately.

## 3-1. When TNX rises
- Money shifts from risk assets → U.S. Treasury bonds  
- USD strengthens as yields rise  
- Emerging markets face selling pressure  
- Corporate borrowing costs rise  
- Equity valuations (PER, PBR) contract  

## 3-2. When TNX falls
- Liquidity returns to equities  
- Growth stocks outperform  
- KRW strengthens and foreign capital flows into Korea  
- Leveraged companies gain breathing room

# 5. Why TNX Acts as a “Discount Rate”

All asset pricing boils down to one formula:

**Present Value (PV) = Future Value / (1 + r)^t**

Here, **r = TNX**.  
As TNX rises, the denominator increases → **present value of growth companies falls**.

This is why:

- Nasdaq  
- Semiconductor stocks  
- High-growth tech companies  

respond dramatically to TNX.

# 7. Table 1 — Korea’s Sensitivity to TNX (Example)

| Category | Rising TNX | Falling TNX |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| USDKRW rate | KRW weakens | KRW strengthens |
| Foreign investor flows | Net selling | Net buying |
| Growth stocks | Downward pressure | Strong rebound |
| Value stocks | Relative strength | Neutral |
| KOSPI index | Volatility up | Steady upward trend |

---

# 8. Table 2 — Why TNX Matters More for Korea

| No. | Reason | Description |
|----|--------|-------------|
| 1 | High foreign ownership | 30% of KOSPI is foreign-owned |
| 2 | Currency sensitivity | Yield↑ → USD↑ → KRW↓ → stock decline |
| 3 | Growth-heavy industries | High sensitivity to discount-rate changes |
| 4 | Corporate debt structure | Rising yields hurt leveraged firms |
| 5 | Open financial market | Korea reacts faster than most countries |

---

# 9. Why Korea Reacts Faster Than the U.S.

## 9-1. KRW is a “risk-on currency”
KRW is classified globally as a **risk-on/emerging-market currency**.

Meaning:

- Good global sentiment → KRW strengthens  
- TNX rises, oil rises, or USD strengthens → KRW weakens  

## 9-2. Foreign investors = 30% of KOSPI  
When TNX rises and USD strengthens,  
foreign investors automatically reduce Korean equity positions.

This makes Korea one of the **most sensitive markets to TNX**.

# 10. How to Use TNX — Beginner vs Experienced Investor

## 10-1. For beginners
