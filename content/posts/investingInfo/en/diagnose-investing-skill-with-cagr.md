# Diagnosing Your Investing Skill with CAGR  
— *A complete guide using MDD, volatility, and the Sharpe ratio* —

> **10-Sentence Summary**  
> 1) CAGR reveals how much your money actually grew over time.  
> 2) However, CAGR alone cannot measure the risk you took to achieve that return.  
> 3) Volatility and drawdowns may drastically differ even when two portfolios have the same CAGR.  
> 4) MDD (Maximum Drawdown) shows the deepest loss your portfolio experienced.  
> 5) Volatility (VOL) reflects how much your returns fluctuated.  
> 6) The Sharpe ratio indicates how effectively you earned returns relative to risk.  
> 7) A portfolio with moderate returns but low volatility can be superior to a high-CAGR portfolio with large drawdowns.  
> 8) Investors often overestimate their investing skill by looking only at CAGR.  
> 9) Combining CAGR, MDD, VOL, and Sharpe creates a complete picture of investing performance.  
> 10) This article uses two real portfolio scenarios to help you evaluate your own investing skill objectively.

> **One-paragraph summary**  
CAGR is one of the most important return metrics, but it hides all information about volatility and risk. To understand your true investing performance, you must evaluate CAGR together with MDD, volatility, and the Sharpe ratio. These metrics show how stable your returns were, how deep your losses got, and whether the risks you took were justified. In this article, we explain each metric in simple terms and compare two sample portfolios to illustrate why a stable CAGR is more valuable than a high but unstable one.

# 1. Introduction  
When investors talk about their results, they often summarize everything with a single number:

**“My CAGR is 9% over the last five years.”**

But this raises critical questions:

- Was the growth stable or extremely volatile?  
- Did the portfolio experience large losses?  
- Was the return achieved efficiently relative to risk?  
- How difficult would it be for most investors to maintain this strategy?

CAGR provides the final outcome, but it does **not** tell the story behind it.

To accurately assess investing skill, professionals always evaluate:

- CAGR (Growth)
- MDD (Drawdown)
- VOL (Volatility)
- Sharpe Ratio (Risk-adjusted efficiency)

This article explains how these four metrics work together and how to use them to diagnose your own investing patterns.

    <p class="hero-kicker">Why CAGR alone is not enough</p>
    <p class="hero-summary">
      CAGR accurately shows how much your money grew,  
      but it tells nothing about the risk taken during the journey.  
      To evaluate real investing skill, you must combine CAGR with MDD, volatility,  
      and the Sharpe ratio to understand how stable and efficient your returns were.

# 3. The Limitation of CAGR: It Does Not Reflect Volatility  
CAGR answers the question:

**“How much did my portfolio grow from start to finish?”**

But two investors with the same CAGR may have had wildly different experiences:

- Investor A had smooth returns with few declines  
- Investor B survived multiple deep losses and large swings  

Even with identical CAGR, the emotional difficulty and sustainability differ dramatically.

<div class="callout-tip">
  <strong>Core Insight:</strong>  
  CAGR shows the result, but not the journey.  
  The journey often determines whether an investor can realistically maintain the strategy.
</div>

# 4. What Is MDD (Maximum Drawdown)?  
MDD answers:

**“What was the deepest drop from peak to bottom?”**

Example:  
Peak $1,000 → Bottom $700 → **MDD = -30%**

MDD reflects:

- Psychological pressure  
- Strategy risk level  
- Likelihood of quitting during crashes  
- Portfolio fragility  

Most investors underestimate how important MDD is until they experience a deep drawdown themselves.

---

# 5. Explaining the Sharpe Ratio for Beginners  
The Sharpe ratio measures:

**“How efficiently did you earn returns relative to risk?”**

Formula:
Sharpe Ratio = (Portfolio Return − Risk-free Rate) / Volatility


Interpretation:

- High Sharpe → stable and efficient returns  
- Low Sharpe → returns achieved with roller-coaster volatility  
- Negative Sharpe → risk was not rewarded  

For beginners, simply remember:

**Sharpe tells you whether your returns were worth the risk.**

# 6. Table 1 — Comparing CAGR, Volatility, and Sharpe Ratio

| Portfolio | CAGR | Volatility | MDD | Sharpe Ratio | Interpretation |
|-----------|------|------------|------|---------------|----------------|
| A | 8% | 10% | -15% | 0.6 | Stable mid-return |
| B | 10% | 25% | -40% | 0.3 | High return but very risky |
| C | 7% | 8% | -10% | 0.7 | Efficient and low volatility |
| D | 12% | 35% | -50% | 0.2 | Hard to maintain long-term |

➡ Higher CAGR ≠ Better investing skill  
➡ Portfolios C and A represent **stronger, more sustainable investing discipline**

# 7. Two Portfolio Scenarios (Realistic Comparison)

## **Scenario 1 — High CAGR, high volatility**
- CAGR: 11%  
- MDD: -45%  
- Volatility: 28%  
- Sharpe: 0.35  

Characteristics:
- Excellent when markets rise  
- Extremely painful in downturns  
- Requires strong psychological tolerance  
- Difficult to maintain with regular contributions  

---

## **Scenario 2 — Moderate CAGR, low volatility**
- CAGR: 8%  
- MDD: -12%  
- Volatility: 10%  
- Sharpe: 0.65  

Characteristics:
- More stable balance  
- Ideal for long-term, consistent investing  
- Easier to maintain emotionally  
- More sustainable across market cycles

# 8. Table 2 — Scenario 1 vs Scenario 2 Comparison

| Metric | Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 | Better Performer |
|--------|------------|------------|------------------|
| CAGR | 11% | 8% | 1 |
| Volatility | 28% | 10% | 2 |
| MDD | -45% | -12% | 2 |
| Sharpe | 0.35 | 0.65 | 2 |
| Difficulty to Maintain | Very High | Low | 2 |
| Long-term Survival | Low | High | 2 |

➡ **Scenario 2 represents true investing skill — stable, efficient, and sustainable**

# 10. Checklist — How to Diagnose Your Investing Skill

- Never evaluate performance using CAGR alone  
- Check MDD to understand your portfolio’s stress points  
- Review volatility to see how stable your returns are  
- Aim for Sharpe 0.5 or higher for long-term strategies  
- Prioritize consistency over maximizing returns  
- Avoid strategies with extreme swings unless intentional  
- Long-term success depends on sustainability, not raw performance  

---

# 11. Conclusion (3 Lines)

1) CAGR is important but insufficient for evaluating investing skill.  
2) MDD, volatility, and Sharpe ratio complete the picture of true performance.  
3) Stable, risk-adjusted returns matter more than chasing high CAGR.

# 13. FAQ

**Q1. Does a higher CAGR mean better investing skill?**  
A: No. Without considering volatility and MDD, the assessment is incomplete.

**Q2. What is considered a “good” Sharpe ratio?**  
A: Generally 0.5 or higher indicates efficient risk management.

**Q3. What is a reasonable MDD level?**  
A: MDD under -15% is relatively stable, depending on strategy.

**Q4. Are high-volatility strategies bad?**  
A: Not always, but they reduce CAGR and are very hard to maintain emotionally.
