# How U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield (TNX) Shapes ETF Performance  
*— A Complete Macro Guide for Growth, Value, Emerging Markets, and Korea —*

> **10-Sentence Summary**
> - TNX is the single most powerful macro variable affecting global ETF performance.  
> - When TNX rises, the discount rate rises → growth ETF valuations fall.  
> - Value ETFs become more resilient because their earnings are current, not far in the future.  
> - A rising dollar typically follows rising TNX, pressuring EM ETFs like EEM and EWY.  
> - Korea’s ETF market is highly growth-centric, making it especially sensitive to yield shocks.  
> - Bond ETFs (TLT, IEF) fall when TNX rises, often sharply.  
> - Commodity ETFs respond to TNX through demand, inflation, and USD pathways.  
> - Capital flows into or out of EM ETFs depend heavily on the TNX–DXY combination.  
> - Understanding TNX helps investors distinguish between short-term noise and structural shifts.  
> - Long-term ETF allocation improves significantly when yield cycles are incorporated.

> Rising TNX compresses valuations, strengthens the USD, alters capital flows, and reshapes ETF performance worldwide.

## 1. Introduction  
Many investors focus on stock earnings, sector themes, or news headlines.  
But ETF performance — especially global ETFs — is driven more by **macro variables**, and among them, **TNX (U.S. 10-year Treasury yield)** is dominant.

TNX affects:
- Discount rates (valuation)
- Capital flows (USD strength)
- Equity risk premium
- EM funding conditions
- Tech sector volatility

Understanding TNX means understanding **where ETF money will move next**.  
This article breaks down the mechanisms clearly, with practical ETF examples.

## 2. Hero Section — “Why TNX Matters More Than Most Investors Realize”
<div class="hero-grid">
  <div class="hero-main">
    <p class="hero-kicker">TNX is the world's benchmark discount rate</p>
    <p class="hero-summary">
      When TNX rises, global asset pricing resets.  
      Growth sectors suffer first, EM markets lose capital, and USD strengthens.  
      This chain reaction explains why many ETFs move together during yield spikes.

    <h3>Main Signals from TNX</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Growth ETF valuation compression</li>
      <li>Emerging-market capital outflows</li>

## 3. How Rising TNX Affects Growth vs. Value ETFs

### 3-1. Growth ETFs Suffer When TNX Rises  
Growth sectors (tech, internet, semiconductors) derive a large share of cash flow far into the future.  
A higher TNX → **higher discount rate** → lower present value.

This disproportionately hits:
- QQQ  
- ARKK  
- SOXX  
- FDN  

A 1% increase in TNX historically leads to **double-digit declines in high-duration growth ETFs**.

---

### 3-2. Value ETFs Hold Up Better  
Value stocks earn money today, not years later.  
Their valuation depends less on discounting future cash flows.

Strong beneficiaries:
- XLF (Financials)
- XLE (Energy)
- VTV (Large Value)
- HDV, SCHD (Dividend Value)

Banks even **benefit** from rising TNX due to widening interest margins (NIM).

<div class="compare-grid">
  <div class="compare-card compare-bad">
    <h3>Growth ETFs Under High TNX</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Severe valuation compression</li>
      <li>High volatility during rate spikes</li>
      <li>Cash flow far in the future → duration risk</li>
      <li>Largest drawdowns during tightening cycles</li>

      <li>Financials benefit from higher yields</li>
      <li>Less sensitive to discount-rate changes</li>

## 5. Emerging-Market ETFs: TNX + USD = Dual Pressure

When TNX rises:
1. U.S.-bound capital increases  
2. USD strengthens  
3. EM currencies weaken  
4. Dollar-denominated debt pressure increases  
5. EM ETF returns fall sharply

Most vulnerable ETFs:
- **EEM** (Global EM)
- **EWY** (Korea)
- **EWZ** (Brazil)
- **INDA** (India)

Korea (EWY) is particularly sensitive because:
- KRW weakens quickly under USD strength  
- Korea is export-driven  
- Heavy technology weighting → high duration

## 7. Two Essential Tables for ETF Analysis

### 7-1. Growth vs. Value Sensitivity Table  
| ETF Type | Influence of TNX | Sensitivity | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------------|-------|
| Growth (QQQ, ARKK) | Strong negative | ★★★★★ | Long duration cash flows |
| Semiconductors (SOXX) | Negative | ★★★★☆ | Valuation-driven |
| Value (VTV, XLF) | Mild/Positive | ★★☆☆☆ | Higher NIM for financials |
| Energy (XLE) | Mixed | ★★★☆☆ | Inflation dependent |

---

### 7-2. EM ETF Sensitivity Table  
| ETF | Key Driver | TNX Impact | Currency Impact | Combined Risk |
|-----|------------|------------|------------------|----------------|
| EEM | USD flows | High | High | ★★★★★ |
| EWY | KRW weakness | High | Very High | ★★★★★ |
| INDA | Domestic demand | Medium | Low | ★★☆☆☆ |
| EWZ | Commodities | Medium | Medium | ★★★☆☆ |

## 8. Korea: The Most TNX-Sensitive Developed Market ETF

Korea’s ETF structure is dominated by:
- Semiconductors (Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix)
- Internet/Platform
- Battery/EV supply chain

These are **long-duration, high-growth industries**, making EWY (and Korean ETFs generally) among the most TNX-sensitive in the world.

## 9. Checklist — “Before Buying Any ETF During High TNX”
- Is the ETF growth or value heavy?  
- Does the ETF depend on future cash flow?  
- Does the ETF rely on USD funding?  
- Does the ETF belong to an EM with FX risk?  
- Is the ETF’s sector cyclical or defensive?  
- Does the ETF benefit from higher yields (e.g., financials)?  
- What is the historical behavior of this ETF in past rate cycles?  
- Is the ETF vulnerable to USD strength?  

---

## 10. Conclusion (3 Lines)
- TNX deeply influences global ETF performance through valuation, liquidity, and currency channels.  
- Growth, EM, and tech-heavy ETFs suffer the most during yield spikes.  
- ETF investors gain a major advantage by adding TNX to their regular monitoring routine.

## 12. FAQ

### Q1. Why does TNX affect ETFs more than individual stocks?  
Because ETF baskets amplify macro sensitivity. Growth-heavy ETFs, especially, move as a group under yield shocks.

### Q2. Why do EM ETFs fall when TNX rises?  
TNX↑ → USD↑ → EM currency↓ → EM capital outflows → ETF declines.

### Q3. Are bond ETFs always negatively affected?  
Long-duration Treasury ETFs (TLT) fall when TNX rises. Short-duration ETFs are less sensitive.

### Q4. Do rising yields always mean falling stocks?  
Not always — early in tightening cycles, financial and energy ETFs often outperform.
