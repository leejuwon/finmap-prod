# Who Wins and Loses When the KRW Weakens?  
## A Practical Sector Map for the KOSPI

> **Summary (10 key points)**  
> - A rising USD/KRW means a weaker Korean won, but market impact varies by sector.  
> - Export-oriented companies may benefit from currency translation effects.  
> - Import-dependent sectors often face higher cost pressure.  
> - Consumer and domestic sectors are affected indirectly through inflation.  
> - Commodity and energy prices amplify FX effects when they move together.  
> - Battery and advanced manufacturing sectors face mixed outcomes.  
> - Airlines and transport are among the most FX-sensitive industries.  
> - FX volatility often leads foreign investors to reduce risk exposure.  
> - Exchange rates matter most through **business structure**, not headlines.  
> - This article provides a sector-by-sector checklist for weak-won regimes.

> **One-paragraph overview**  
When the Korean won weakens, investors often ask a simple question: “Which stocks benefit?”  
The real answer is more nuanced. A weaker KRW changes revenue translation, input costs, inflation expectations, and foreign capital flows—each affecting sectors differently. This guide breaks down how major KOSPI sectors tend to respond when USD/KRW rises, using tables and practical checklists rather than broad generalizations.

## 1. First Principle: A Weak Won Is Not “Good” or “Bad”

A weaker currency does not automatically mean higher stock prices.  
Instead, it **reshapes profit and risk distribution across sectors**.

Before labeling a stock as a “beneficiary,” ask:
- Does it earn revenue in USD?  
- Does it pay costs in USD?  
- Can it pass higher costs to customers?  
- Is foreign ownership significant?

These factors determine outcomes far more than the FX headline itself.

---

## 2. Four Main Channels Through Which FX Affects Sectors

◈ **1) Revenue translation**  
Companies with USD-denominated revenue may report higher KRW earnings.

◈ **2) Cost inflation**  
Firms importing raw materials or components in USD face rising costs.

◈ **3) Inflation and rates**  
Higher import prices can raise inflation expectations and pressure valuations.

◈ **4) Foreign investor behavior**  
Rising FX volatility often leads to cautious positioning and reduced exposure.

## 3. Core Table ① — Sector Impact Overview in a Weak-Won Environment

| Sector | Typical Impact When KRW Weakens | Key Factors to Check |
|---|---|---|
| Export manufacturing | Potential benefit | USD revenue share, hedging |
| Import & retail | Cost pressure | Pricing power |
| Domestic services | Indirect impact | Inflation, consumer sentiment |
| Commodities & energy | Often negative | FX + global prices |
| Battery / advanced tech | Mixed | Export vs raw materials |
| Airlines & transport | Vulnerable | Fuel costs, FX exposure |
| Financials | Neutral to volatile | Rates, capital flows |

This table describes **structural tendencies**, not guaranteed price moves.

---

## 4. Sector-by-Sector Checklists

### 4-1. Export-Oriented Sectors (Tech, Autos, Machinery)

**Potential upside**, but not automatic.

Checklist:
- High USD revenue exposure?  
- Input costs also USD-based?  
- FX hedging ratio disclosed?  
- Global demand still intact?

◈ *Weak KRW + stable global demand*  
→ earnings expectations may improve.

---

### 4-2. Import-Heavy and Consumer Sectors

**Generally under pressure**.

Checklist:
- Imported input share?  
- Ability to raise prices?  
- Consumer sentiment already weak?

◈ FX-driven cost increases are hardest to absorb when demand is soft.

---

### 4-3. Domestic and Service Sectors

**Indirect exposure dominates**.

Checklist:
- Speed of inflation pass-through  
- Interest-rate expectations  
- Sensitivity to foreign investor flows

◈ FX matters mainly through **inflation and rates**, not revenue.

---

### 4-4. Commodity and Energy-Sensitive Industries

**Double-impact risk**.

Checklist:
- Are global prices rising alongside FX?  
- Can costs be hedged or passed through?

◈ *Weak KRW + rising oil prices*  
→ margin pressure intensifies.

For this linkage, see  
**[Inflation and Interest Rates Explained]**  
[Inflation and Interest Rates Explained](/en/posts/economicInfo/inflation-rate-basics)

---

### 4-5. Battery and Advanced Manufacturing

**Most complex category**.

Checklist:
- Export share vs imported raw materials  
- Long-term supply contracts  
- Exposure to USD-priced metals

◈ Currency benefits and cost pressures often coexist.

---

### 4-6. Airlines and Transportation

**Among the most FX-sensitive sectors**.

Checklist:
- Fuel cost exposure in USD  
- FX + oil price correlation  
- Fare adjustment flexibility

◈ Weak KRW combined with rising oil prices is the worst-case scenario.

## 5. Core Table ② — Investor Checklist for Weak-Won Phases

| Question | If “Yes” | If “No” |
|---|---|---|
| USD costs exceed USD revenue? | Margin risk | Re-check structure |
| Limited pricing power? | Earnings pressure | Competitive position |
| High foreign ownership? | Volatility risk | Flow monitoring |
| Rising oil/commodities too? | Double pressure | Separate drivers |
| Low FX hedging ratio? | Higher volatility | Disclosure review |

---

## 6. Three Common Misconceptions

**1) “A weak won always helps exporters.”**  
→ Cost structure and demand conditions matter.

**2) “FX is separate from equities.”**  
→ FX directly affects foreign flows and valuation.

**3) “Watching USD/KRW alone is enough.”**  
→ Rates, commodities, and global risk sentiment must be included.

---

## 7. How to Use This Map in Practice

1) Focus on **business structure**, not labels.  
2) Break “winners and losers” into checklists.  
3) Monitor foreign flows and rate expectations.  
4) Accept that companies within the same sector differ.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Does a weaker KRW always benefit exporters?
Not necessarily. While USD-denominated revenue increases in KRW terms, higher input costs and FX hedging can offset the benefit.

### Why are airlines sensitive to exchange rates?
Fuel costs are typically paid in USD. When the KRW weakens and oil prices rise together, cost pressure intensifies.

### How does USD/KRW affect foreign investors?
Higher FX volatility increases currency risk, often leading foreign investors to reduce exposure to Korean equities.

### Is FX impact stronger than interest rates?
FX and interest rates are closely linked. In many cases, FX moves transmit their impact through rate expectations.

### Should investors focus on the exchange rate level or volatility?
Volatility matters more than absolute levels, especially for foreign capital flows.

## Conclusion (3 lines)

A weaker Korean won redistributes opportunity and risk across sectors.  
The key variable is not the FX move itself, but **how each sector is built**.  
Use structure-driven checklists to reduce noise and improve decisions.
