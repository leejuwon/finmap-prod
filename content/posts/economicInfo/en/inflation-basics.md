# Understanding Inflation: CPI, Perceived Inflation, and Real Interest Rates

> **Summary:**  
> Inflation refers to a sustained increase in overall price levels, which reduces the purchasing power of money.  
> A key concept for new investors is **real interest rate = nominal interest rate − inflation rate**.  
> When the real interest rate is negative, savings accounts and cash-based assets lose purchasing power.

## Why Inflation Matters

- Even with the same amount of money, rising prices mean you can **buy less**.  
- Households face higher living costs, companies face increased production expenses,  
  and central banks respond with **interest rate policies**.  
- Understanding inflation is essential for long-term financial planning.

## CPI vs. Perceived Inflation

- **CPI (Consumer Price Index):**  
  The official measure of inflation based on a fixed basket of goods with assigned weights.

- **Perceived Inflation:**  
  The inflation individuals *feel*, based on their personal spending patterns.

Even when official CPI is low, inflation may feel higher if frequently purchased items  
such as food delivery, housing, or transportation rise significantly.

### Tip: Track Your Personal Cost of Living

You can quantify your perceived inflation by tracking  
**monthly price changes** using card statements, shopping apps, or spreadsheets.

## Why Inflation Occurs

- **Demand-Pull Inflation:**  
  Economic expansion, wage growth, increased government spending → demand exceeds supply.

- **Cost-Push Inflation:**  
  Rising commodity/energy prices or a weaker currency → higher production costs.

- **Expectational Inflation:**  
  When people believe “prices will keep rising,” that expectation itself leads businesses to raise prices.

## Inflation and Interest Rates (Real Interest Rate)

- **Real Interest Rate = Nominal Interest Rate − Inflation Rate**  
- A **negative** real interest rate means cash and deposits **lose purchasing power** over time.  
- Example: Deposit 3% – Inflation 4% = **Real Interest Rate −1%**

### Example Table

| Case | Nominal Rate | Inflation Rate | Real Rate |
|------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| A | 3% | 4% | -1% |
| B | 5% | 3% | +2% |

## What Inflation Signals for Financial Markets

- **Bonds:**  
  Higher interest rates → lower bond prices (due to higher discount rates).

- **Stocks:**  
  Inflation can pressure equities short term,  
  but productivity improvements or strong earnings can offset the impact.

- **Real Estate:**  
  Rising mortgage rates reduce buying demand,  
  but rental income and supply conditions can create mixed effects.

## Practical Tips to Manage Inflation

- Lock in costs through **long-term contracts** or subscriptions where possible.  
- Use **diversification** to reduce single-asset risk.  
- During rate-hike cycles, maintain **healthy cash flow**, including monthly savings and emergency funds.
