> **Summary:**  
> The exchange rate represents the relative price of two currencies. USD/KRW is influenced by a wide range of variables such as interest rate differentials, trade balance, risk-off sentiment, and global liquidity.

# What Is an Exchange Rate?

- It represents **how many Korean won are required to buy 1 US dollar (USD/KRW)**.  
- It directly affects exporters’ profitability, import prices, overseas travel costs, and tuition for studying abroad.

# Key Factors That Drive USD/KRW Movements

## Interest Rate Differentials  
When Korea’s interest rate is lower than the US rate, it generally strengthens the US dollar due to increased demand for USD-denominated assets.

## Trade and Current Account Balance  
A widening surplus usually strengthens the domestic currency, while a deficit can weaken it.

## Risk-Off Sentiment  
During global uncertainty, investors prefer safe-haven currencies such as the US dollar, often leading to USD appreciation.

## Commodity and Energy Prices  
Higher import costs create depreciation pressure on the Korean won, especially in an energy-dependent economy like Korea.

## Capital Flows  
Foreign investors’ buying or selling of Korean equities and bonds has a direct impact on demand for Korean won.

# Exchange Rates and Inflation

- A rising USD/KRW rate increases import prices, which later affects consumer inflation.  
- A weaker Korean won boosts the value of overseas assets when converted back to KRW, which can be beneficial for global investors.

# What Individuals Should Pay Attention To

- **Travel / Study Abroad / Online Shopping:**  
  Consider timing your currency exchange, as these categories are highly sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations.

- **Overseas Investments:**  
  Use dollar-cost averaging, understand hedged vs. unhedged products, and monitor periods of strong capital inflows/outflows.
