# Understanding Interest Rates: Policy Rates, Market Rates, and How They Influence Deposits, Loans, and Bonds

> **Summary:**  
> The policy rate acts as the anchor for short-term benchmark rates.  
> It affects bank funding costs, which in turn influence lending and deposit rates.  
> Higher rates increase discount rates, leading to lower bond prices due to their inverse relationship.

## 1. What Is an Interest Rate?

Interest rates represent the **price of time** in financial markets.  
They reflect compensation for risk, liquidity, and the time value of money.

General principles:

- Higher risk → **higher interest rates**  
- Longer maturity → **term premium** (higher rate compared to short-term)

## 2. From Policy Rate → Market Rates → Deposit and Loan Rates

Interest rates flow through the system in the following sequence:

1. The central bank sets the **policy rate** (base rate).  
2. This influences **short-term market rates**, such as call rates or benchmark reference rates.  
3. Changes in bank funding costs lead to adjustments in **deposit and lending rates** for households and businesses.

This chain determines borrowing costs, deposit returns, and investment incentives across the economy.

## 3. The Inverse Relationship Between Interest Rates and Bonds

Interest rates and bond prices move in opposite directions because of the way discounting works:

- When interest rates rise  
  → discount rates rise  
  → **present value of fixed cash flows falls**  
  → bond prices decline  

- When interest rates fall  
  → discount rates fall  
  → bond prices rise  

Existing fixed-rate bonds become less attractive when new bonds offer higher yields.

## 4. How Interest Rates Affect Everyday Life

Interest rate changes impact:

- **Mortgage and housing loans:**  
  Higher rates increase monthly payments and reduce borrowing capacity.

- **Deposit and savings products:**  
  Higher rates increase interest income for savers.

- **Corporate investment:**  
  Higher borrowing costs reduce capital spending and hiring.

Changes in the interest rate cycle flow through the entire economy.

## 5. Practical Checkpoints for Individuals

- **Fixed vs. Variable Rates:**  
  Consider the interest rate cycle before choosing.

- **Loan Repayment Structure:**  
  Understand “equal principal & interest” vs “equal principal” repayment schedules.

- **Investments:**  
  Monitor how changes in the **discount rate** affect company valuations.
