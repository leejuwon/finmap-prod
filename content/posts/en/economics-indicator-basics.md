> **Summary:**  
> All economic indicators are a comparison game between **actual vs. forecast vs. previous data**. Market volatility often occurs when the actual reading drastically deviates from expectations.

# GDP (Gross Domestic Product)

- Represents the total value of all final goods and services produced within an economy during a specific period.  
- Released quarterly and interpreted mainly through **QoQ (quarter-over-quarter)** and **YoY (year-over-year)** comparisons.

# Unemployment Rate

- Considered a **lagging indicator**, reflecting changes in the labor market after economic shifts occur.  
- Influences **consumer spending outlook** through wage trends and hiring conditions.

# PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index)

- A diffusion index where **50** separates economic expansion from contraction.  
- Serves as a **leading indicator**, offering early insight into business sentiment in manufacturing and services.

# Why Release Calendars Matter

- Economic indicators must be read with their **release calendar**, always checking **forecast** and **previous** values together.  
- For indicators with historically high volatility, it is important to keep **position sizing** conservative.
