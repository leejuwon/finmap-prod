## 1. Introduction

Starting your first full-time job often comes with excitement—until you realize how little you know about managing your money.  
Many young professionals struggle with:

- “Where did my money go?”  
- “Should I start with savings or investing?”  
- “What is the right monthly spending limit?”

This guide breaks salary management into **five simple steps** anyone can follow.

---

## 2. Step 1 — Identify Your Fixed Expenses

### 2-1. Why list your expenses first?

Salary management begins with knowing **exactly where your money goes**.  
Without a clear picture of fixed expenses, it’s nearly impossible to budget effectively.

Typical fixed expenses include:

- Rent / utilities  
- Mobile phone bill  
- Insurance premiums  
- Transportation  
- Subscription services  

Example:  
If fixed expenses are **$640/month** and your salary is **$2,000/month**,  
→ fixed expenses account for **32%** of your income.

The remaining 68% must cover spending, savings, and investing.

---

### 2-2. Review fixed expenses three times

Fixed expenses are not “set forever.”  
Reviewing them regularly can save $20–$50 per month,  
which is $240–$600 per year.

Three key review questions:

1. **Is this expense truly necessary?**  
   – Cancel unused subscriptions  
2. **Is there a cheaper alternative?**  
   – Phone plans and insurance can often be downsized  
3. **Is the billing cycle optimal?**  
   – Annual plans may be cheaper than monthly ones  

---

## 3. Step 2 — Set a Monthly Spending Limit

### 3-1. The biggest mistake beginners make

“Save whatever is left at the end of the month” almost never works.  
If you can spend, you *will* spend.

This is why **save-first, spend-later** is essential.

---

### 3-2. Use the 50-30-20 Rule (Adjusted for young professionals)

| Category | % | Description |
|---------|----|-------------|
| Essentials | 50% | Rent + core living expenses |
| Self-Development / Leisure | 20% | Courses, gym, hobbies |
| Savings / Investing | 30% | Emergency fund, savings accounts, investments |

**Example: $2,000 monthly income**

- Essentials: **$1,000**  
- Self-development: **$400**  
- Savings & investing: **$600**

Adjust the percentages depending on your situation—  
the key is **setting a limit in advance**.

---

## 4. Step 3 — Build an Emergency Fund (6 Months of Living Costs)

![Emergency fund illustration](/images/economics/economics-personal-start-5steps-mid3-emergencyfund.png)

### 4-1. Why emergency funds come before investing

Before investing, build a **financial safety net**.  
Without an emergency fund, unexpected expenses—car repairs, medical bills, sudden moves—force you to break savings or investments.

**Standard emergency fund target:**  
6 months of essential expenses.

Example:  
If living expenses are **$950/month**,  
Emergency fund target = **$5,700**

---

### 4-2. Where should you keep it?

Safety and accessibility matter more than return.

Recommended:

- CMA accounts  
- High-liquidity savings accounts  
- Standard checking/savings accounts  

---

## 5. Step 4 — Use Savings Accounts to Build Discipline

### 5-1. Savings accounts are “training tools”

They don’t offer high returns but are ideal for building the habit of saving.  
For young professionals, **consistency is the highest priority**.

### 5-2. Recommended saving ratio

- 10%–20% of monthly income  
- Prefer 12–24 month terms  
- Use automatic transfers to stay consistent  

---

## 6. Step 5 — Grow Your Wealth Through Compound Investing

### 6-1. Compound interest is your strongest advantage

After building discipline through saving,  
transition into **compound-growth assets**.

Compound interest means **earning interest on interest**.  
Time dramatically accelerates growth.

Example:  
$300/month for 10 years at 5% return:

- Simple interest: approx. **$5,160** earned  
- Compound interest: approx. **$5,940** earned  
→ Difference: **$780**

This gap grows much larger over 15–20 years.

### 6-2. Try your own numbers (CTA)

Try changing the numbers yourself using the calculator:

## 7. Conclusion — 3 Things to Remember

1. Salary management starts with knowing your spending.  
2. The safest order is: **Emergency Fund → Savings → Compound Investing**  
3. Starting early is more important than starting big.

---

## FAQ

### **Q1. My salary is small. How can I start saving?**
Start with small automatic transfers—$50 or $100 per month.  
The habit matters more than the amount.

### **Q2. Can I save and invest at the same time?**
Yes, as long as your emergency fund is secured first.
