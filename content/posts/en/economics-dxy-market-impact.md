# How DXY Moves the Market

> **10-sentence summary**  
1. DXY reflects the relative strength of the U.S. dollar.  
2. Rising DXY often signals risk-off sentiment and shrinking global liquidity.  
3. Higher U.S. interest rates generally push DXY upward.  
4. Dollar strength hurts U.S. multinational companies by reducing overseas revenue.  
5. DXY and USD/KRW show strong correlation, with DXY strength leading to KRW weakness.  
6. KRW weakness increases foreign investors’ FX risk, often causing selling pressure in KOSPI.  
7. When DXY exceeds the 105–106 range, emerging markets often face capital outflows.  
8. Falling DXY improves liquidity conditions and supports risk assets.  
9. Analysts evaluate DXY together with interest rates and liquidity to understand market cycles.  
10. Investors should treat DXY as a core macro indicator, not just a currency measurement.

> **One-paragraph summary**  
DXY is a key macro indicator that influences global risk sentiment, liquidity, U.S. stock performance, USD/KRW, and Korea’s KOSPI. A rising DXY is usually negative for risk assets, while a falling DXY supports market recovery.

## 2. Market Reactions When DXY Rises

### ✔ 2-1. Stronger demand for the dollar  
Risk-off sentiment increases and investors move toward safe assets.

### ✔ 2-2. Negative pressure on U.S. stocks  
Dollar strength reduces overseas revenue for multinational companies.

### ✔ 2-3. High correlation with USD/KRW

## 3. DXY vs Interest Rates vs Liquidity

A crucial three-way relationship:

### ✔ (1) Higher U.S. interest rates → DXY strengthens  
Higher yields attract global capital.

### ✔ (2) Stronger DXY → Global liquidity tightens  
Emerging-market outflows accelerate.

### ✔ (3) Lower liquidity → Stock markets weaken  
Both U.S. tech stocks and KOSPI become more volatile.
