## 1. Introduction  
Many beginner investors wonder why annual and monthly compounding produce different results.  
The reason is simple: **the more often interest is applied, the faster the balance grows**.  
This small difference becomes noticeable when comparing long-term results or goal timelines.

---

## 2. Understanding the basics  

### ● Annual compounding  
- Interest applied once per year  
- Example: 5% → 1.05× after one year  

### ● Monthly compounding  
- Interest applied 12 times per year  
- Same 5% annual rate becomes:  
  - Monthly rate = 0.05 / 12  
  - Effective annual rate ≈ **5.12%**

## 3. Example: $10,000 invested for 10 years

| Type | Formula | Final Amount |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Annual | 10,000 × (1.05)<sup>10</sup> | $16,288.95 |
| Monthly | 10,000 × (1 + 0.05/12)<sup>120</sup> | $16,470.09 |

**→ Monthly compounding is about $181 higher.**

## 4. Time to reach a target amount ($20,000 goal)

| Basis | Annual 5% | Monthly 5% |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Time needed | ~14.2 years | ~14.0 years |

### ● Short-term investments show negligible differences  
For periods under one year, the variance is tiny.

### ● For long-term investing, monthly compounding is generally more advantageous  
Especially when combined with regular contributions.
